 <p> One thing you must remember throughout high school and college is to remain calm and motivated. Its always ok to take a break and focus on yourself. Your your mental and
   physical health is just as important as school work. Don't forget to take some time to focus on yourself. You are able to accomplish much more when you are free of stress.

   <br>
   <h2>Go outside</h2>

<p> Step away from your electronic devices for a while and take a walk. Enjoy the fresh air. When you go for walk, use this time
  to disconnect and relect on whats stressing you out. Instead of using this quiet time to stress yourself out even more, think of
  ways to solve your problem OR simply do something to keep your mind off of what is stressing you out. Its ok to take a BREAK.</p>

  <p> Lets be real, the older we get, the more sleep we start to appreciate. Nowadays it seems almost impossible to maintain 8 hours of
    sleep in our daily shedule. However that doesn't mean we should work at the expense of our sleeping time.Your brain cannot
    function smoothly if it doesnt rest for a while. Also, be aware that sleep and insomnia are directly related. The more stresed out you are,
   the harder it will be for you to sleep.
   <br>
   <h3>Listen to Music</h3>

   <P> Music is the best thing you can do to relieve stress. Music is very theraputic weather ou are listening to it
     or creating it! So when you feel stressed while studying or doing homework, play some music. According to a music
     study, classical music by Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, and Chopin will increase your focus while doing homework or studying.
